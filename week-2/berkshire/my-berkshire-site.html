<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was pretty cool!  It was kind of a crash course / refresher but, it was nice being able to make something out of what I had just learned.  It's good practice :]
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
It was fine for the most part.  Picked up concepts fairly well and they stuck with me.  Tables are still something I need more experience with but, I think I got the hang of it.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
Great because I don't know how to style anything really lol so I avoided doing so especially since we were instructed not to (yet)
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
It's pretty easy to read, so long as you make sure you indent where appropriate.  I can't really think of anything I'd say was bad.. Nothing I came across at least.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Always start with <!DOCTYPE html>
Easy way to not lose track of tags is to immediately create the ending tag of whatever you just created, then work between the tags.  Always double check, however (I was having trouble initially because I typed in <il></il> instead of <li></li> ... small little errors make you worry when it doesnt seem to be working right)
