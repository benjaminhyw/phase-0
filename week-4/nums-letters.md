What is an integer? What is a float?
An integer is any whole number, like 1, 800, 945784346789, 23, etc.
A float is a number with a decimal, so 2.3, -5.98, 6.66, etc.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
Float division uses decimals whereas integer division does not.  What this means, is in float division you could do something like 9.0/2.0 an get 4.5.  In integer division however, 9/2 would result in 4.

Pretend you're at an arcade, and you want to play a game.  Machine takes two quarters, and you have 9 on you.  That means you can play a total of 4 rounds, because the machine will not accept one quarter for a shorter game.
