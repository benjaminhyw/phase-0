        What are the benefits of version control?

        Version control is an awesome thing, let me tell you!  Essentially version control is a data log of all of your previous edits.  It’s almost like a selfie... in the sense that you can see changes over time!  If you post enough selfies, you’ll see how things change over time.  Features, expressions, preferred background / props.. etc.  Every selfie is different, regardless of how similar that duck face looks.  Similarly with version control, you can see what changes your code has gone through!  You can see when changes were made, what changes were made, and by whom!  It’s a great way to be aware of what’s going on with the code.  It’s also good because if for whatever reason you need to check on what it looked like before, you have the ability to do so!  Keeping track of the past helps pave the way when moving forward!

          How does git help you keep track of changes?

          So first let’s start by learning a little about what Git is.  Git is software that equips files and folders with version control.  Any one of your already existing (or future folders) can be used with Git.  Essentially once you start working Git in a file, you’ve enabled version control.  You can keep track of changes by learning simple commands to help you navigate!

          git log for example, presents you with all of the commits in the code.  That information is helpful because it provides you with information about the changes that were made in the code!  By adding git, you gain version control, which allows you to navigate through all of its edits.

          Why use GitHub to store your code?

          So what’s so great about GitHub anyway?!
          Github is an online cloud.  What this means is it’s a big fluffy online space to store your code!  It has a pretty large community, and developers everywhere can jump in on your code and work at it!  This is cool because it means you’re not alone!  When it comes to working with groups, GitHub makes it easy.  If you’re stuck you can get some help, and if you feel like helping someone else you can help them so they’re no longer stuck!  Or if you simply just wanna work on the same code together, what better way to do so than by using GitHub!  It’s also good to use an online cloud in general, because you never know what could happen to your computer... Hopefully nothing bad ever happens to your computer!  But y’know, stuff happens... and if it does, GitHub has your back!  All you gotta do is sign in from another computer and you’re good to get back to work!

<!--
What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
I had main, section, head, decided to then add header and footer.  These are the ones I seem to use the most, and it's probably because they're key elements when it comes to creating/reading a page!

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
I'm not entirely sure how to answer this one.  They get laid out based on the order they were typed in.  So essentially from top to bottom, following tags within tags etc etc.  The browser displays them accordingly.


What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? 
I learned that you can create shortcuts called snippets, which is nice when working on a project.  You can basically create your own so instea of having a basic HTML skeleton you can have one that fits your needs better.

Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
I will definitely create snippets later on.  I have a feeling I'll be creating some for whatever nav links I end up creating to maintain a simila format.
