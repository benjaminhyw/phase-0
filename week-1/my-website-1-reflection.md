Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
So to create a repository, what you're essentially doing is creating a new folder to store files in, make changes, etc.  Making a new one is fairly simple.  On GitHub, you'll see a + symbol at the very top right of the page.  Click on that, then click on "Create new repository".  You'll name it, figure out licensing, then create it!  Once you do that, you'll have a unique HTML link provided to you.  On my screen, it shows up towards the middle/right of the screen.
Once you have that link, you can copy that link and on your terminal, once you're in the directory you want to work in, you simply type in git clone insert-link-here , and that's it!  You have now created a new repository on GitHub and now a cloned version on your local computer to work with :]

Describe what open source means.
Open source means just about anyone can work on the code.  If something is open source, multiple developers can code alongside you.  It's because of open source that things like GitHub are extremely useful, because it allows you to sync and work on the code together.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I feel like open source is looked at depending on each ones current situation.  For example, I myself love it right now.  I think it's awesome because multiple people can do work on the same code, and it allows people to work as a team towards something.  I think it's a good platform to learn, because you'll be able to see what changes were made, why they were made... if you can't get something to work on your own, you can see how it worked with someone else and it helps you grow because of it.
However, the links provided also mentioned the example of Adobe Applications like Photoshop, etc.  If those programs were to be open source, then people wouldn't buy them because they'd have access to similar modified versions elsewhere.  From a financial standpoint, open source seems like a good thing for users but maybe not so much for companies with programs like Adobe.  Again, personally I think Open Source is awesome.

Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses are important because it groups together the rules on who can access certain material.  Rather than giving special permission to one individual then another etc., licenses permit people who fall under the rules/category to access without having to request special permision.  Licenses allow people to use your code, but also protects you as the original creator.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
Some of the commands are sticking!  I'm memorizing things omg!  For some reason I keep confusing repositories and branches with one another when I think abou them but when I try and create each one I realize what each one is and why they're different.  I feel pretty confident creating repositories now.

I had an "aha!" moment when I finally got my website to run the index.  That partly had to do with my crazy lack of organization on my desktop, so some cleaning up is in order.. I've had this laptop for like 9 years and i'm just barely tinkering with it like this.. it's exciting!  Anywho, my aha moment was that I accidentally created two index.htmls; a blank one, and one with the html code.  The one I pushed up on GitHub was the empty one and no matter how many times I went thhrough terminal commands to try and figure it out, nothing happened.  It was just a matter of physically seeing where I saved everything and that's how I noticed I had accidentally created two files.  Fixed that :P

One thing I still don't really know is the equivalent of the command cd to backtrack!  Usually I navigate my directories by typing ls to see what's available to get into, then cd name-of-directory.  However if I want to go back to the previous directory... How do I do that?  I've searched online but I guess i'm not searching correctly... I keep coding around this by restarting terminal after finishing my task and just navigating forward again.  There is definitely another way, I must find it!
