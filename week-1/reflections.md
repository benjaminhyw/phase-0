# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection
So even though the instructions said to limit myself to an hour doing going through the readings, I decided to instead go through all of the readings in their entirety.  I did however take a quick break in between links, because I realized I had been sitting down for some time and was starting to get a bit distracted.

I learned about meditation, timeboxing techniques like the "pomodoro", and how to make changes starting by tiny little habits.  Timeboxing is the concept of working towards a specific goal within a certain amount of time, and stopping the activity to then reflect and look at the situation.  This sounds like the Guided Pair Sessions we've learned about, but I think Phase 0 will also require other excercises to test our knowledge where we should work in a similar fashion.  This assignment, for example, asked us to give ourself an hour.  I didn't do so.  I did however, like I mentioned, take a break in between and that was something I saw in one of the links as a good method to stay on track.  If you know you can't do a task for an extended period of time, take a break but keep track of the length as well so you don't sidetrack.  That break made it easier for me to get back to doing the readings.

When it comes to managing my own time, it really varies on the activity.  This one for example said take an hour but the way I looked at it, I have an entire week to get this all done so I wanna do as much as I can to intake as much as possible.
Other tasks I tend to carry out until I "lose form".  I think this stems from my early gym days.  The first gym I ever joined walked me through my personalized exercise plan and they gave me what they recommended my number of sets and reps were.  However they stressed that if I lost my form, that I shouldn't continue the exercise because I wouldn't really be benefiting from a workout with bad form.  I've applied this elsewhere.  If I start getting distracted, or if I notice I start getting sloppy, or anything along those lines.. I try and change it up.  I take breaks if appropriate.  I distract myself enough to be able to get back on track soon enough.  I let myself breathe.

I feel like this works for the most part.  I sometimes get off track but, we're only human.  However I'm able to keep myself in check fairly well.

I will definitely try the new methods I've learned about.  I never use a physical timer like presented in the pomodoro example.  I also don't really meditate.  I like to try new things and see how they work for me so I'll give these a try and start implementing them if they work out for me!

My plan for Phase0 is to get everything done but not go crazy.  I know some of my limits so I will listen to my body when it tells me to change things up a bit.  I'm eager to start this journey, i'm excited to see how things go.  I will try new things when what I usually do doesn't work.


## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection
1) A shell is a command-line interpreter.  Similarly, "bash" is another command-line interpreter that was meant to replace the "Bourne Shell".. I will have to do more research on all of them to get better knowledge because I don't feel like I really know what these all are entirely.

2) I had a hard time watching the hour long video.  I tried to watch it last night but couldn't get through it, gave it another go today and powered through.  I think what made it difficult was that it seemed a little overwhelming because it just was one solid hour of him explaining things but information was given back to back.

3) For the most part yes, I played around with the commands.  However I definitely need to spend more time doing so.  I've bookmarked the crash course and plan on coming back to complete that crash course.

4) As a beginner help sounds nice.  However I know I need to learn to search without needing to use the help command.  Otherwise, I think less is a good one when you have a lot of text to go through.

5) Off the top of my head I really only know cd, rmdir mkdir.  I think i've just grouped these as similar in my head since they all are directory based.  I couldn't find what ../ was so i'll keep looking around.  Otherwise, here's what each of those things mean:

 

pwd = print work directory
ls = list diectory
mv = move file or directory
cd = change directory
../ = ?
touch = creates empty files
mkdir = make directory
less = page through a file
rmdir = remove directory
rm = remove file
help = gives you basic help finding commands if stuck


### 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

Alright new person, I'm about to give you the low down on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone one.  You ready?  I just learned this so bear with me...

CREATE:
1) On GitHub, click on the + symbol next to your username on the very top right corner of the page.
2) Click on "create new repository"
3) Name your new repository (add a brief description, choose your provacy settings, add your license, do all that fun stuff)
4) Click the big green button at the very bottom! "Create repository"!
5) Do a little happy dance. (This step is optional)

FORK:
1) Click on the repository you would like to fork
2) Once you're in that repository, there should be a button at the top right corner that reads "fork"
3) Click the "fork" button
4) Done!

CLONE:
1) Before you clone make sure you fork the repository you'd like to clone.
2) Once you've made sure it has been forked, click on your repository
3) Open up your terminal if you haven't already
4) On the GitHub repository, click on the link provided in the page, copy that link..
5) On terminal, clone it by typing: git clone (this is where you paste your URL)
6) Done .. (?)
This is the part where i'm a little confused.  I watched the video where Emmanuel showed us how to clone, but he went into his Phase 0 directory.. how do I make local folders/directories to then clone into there?  I cloned the challenge using my terminal but I'm not really sure where that cloned or how to direct it to any one spot because I'm not sure how to create and send things to a directory.

Forking is better than creating a new repository when possible because when you fork an already existing repository, you're basically grabbing all of the components and making yourself a copy you can play around with.  If you create a repository, then you have to add all of those components in there.

 Adding this extra line of text just to test push/pull because it doesn't seem to be working for me rn..
